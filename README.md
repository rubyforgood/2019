# 2019 Ruby for Good Projects

### Diaperbase

Each month over 350,000 children are helped by diaper banks, forgoing their parents having to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding their children and putting diapers on them. There are diaper banks in 44 states and they provide about 4 million diapers a month to needy families. We're going to be using the SaaS that we built last year, making it more robust, and polishing it off to be demoed at the National Diaperbank Network conference later this year. Our goal is for this one to be the best Inventory management product available at the lowest (or "no") cost to diaperbanks. We will be working in tandem with PartnerBase, which is a CRM for Community Partners that will work with the Diaperbanks to handle distribution / order fulfillment /family interaction.

### Partnerbase

This is the companion application to the diaper app. The diaper app is an inventory management system and this partner application handles the onboarding, approving, and handling of requests from diaper banks from their partners. Diaper banks do not distribute diapers directly to the public. They distribute diapers to partners like women's shelters, food pantries, homeless shelters, and other organizations. The partnerbase application is used by the great organizations to track individuals and interface with Diaperbase.

### Voices of Consent

Voices of Consent is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide healing to victims, bring awareness to sexual assault, transform society’s response to victims, define what consent is. Based in Washington, DC, this nonprofit operates in 48 states to help survivors in the aftermath of a traumatic event by sending survivor boxes to anyone who requests one free of charge. Boxes are personalized and put together to let survivors know they are not alone after an event and can help provide support as they begin the recovery process including information about laws in their state, free health and counseling services in their area, and other tools and resources needed to start the healing journey. Voices of Consent gets the word out to survivors by talking at schools and churches. The boxes are sent to survivors who request them directly or can be picked up at hospitals or police stations.

### Coral

* Github: https://github.com/rubyforgood/coral
* Slack channel: #coralgardeners

Coral Gardeners is an NGO based in Mo’orea, French Polynesia. Their work revolves around two main areas. First, they are educating adults and children about coral reefs, why they are important and the threats that the reefs face. Second, they use the process of coral gardening to restore reefs by planting healthy coral fragments back onto the reef. Currently, their work takes place primarily on the reef near Mo'orea, which has been heavily impacted. Coral adoptions are a key source of donations for the organization. Each coral adoption is unique and comes with a certificate that provides a picture of the coral, its name and its GPS coordinates. Currently, they produce these certificates in Photoshop with staff spending a significant amount of time on them. The time spent on these, while important, takes away from time they could be spending on work directly related to their mission. This project would automate the process of creating the certificates with the unique information for each coral.

### Abalone

* Slack channel: #abalone
Bodega Marine Laboratory’s white abalone captive breeding program is working to prevent the extinction of these white abalone.  White abalone are one of seven species found in California and are culturally significant to the native people of this area.  White abalone were perilously overfished throughout the 20th century, resulting in a 99 percent population decrease by the end of the 1970s.  This group is working to reverse all of that and have already seen some great success, they currently have more abalone in the lab than exist in the wild!

Excited about their great success, the group was not prepared for the amount of data they wound up with.  So they are in great need of our help.  We will build a database to help them manage their data that will import and export.

### Habitat for Humanity

* Github: https://github.com/rubyforgood/habitatebsv
* Slack channel: #habitatebsv

Habitat for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley seeks to bring people together to build homes, communities and hope. Recognizing the affect that housing has on a community and on individuals, Habitat EB/SV provides programs and services to help make home ownership attainable. These services include home construction, housing counseling and providing home repair resources. Habitat for Humanity works extensively with volunteers and they are required to collect information from these volunteers on site. In many cases, this information is collected on paper forms. After a build day or other volunteer-based event, a staff member from the organization must spend time transcribing this information and entering it into their database. This takes a significant amount of time that could be spent helping in other areas of the organization. This project would improve the process of collecting the volunteer information and preparing it for entry/import into the appropriate databases.

### Babywearing

* Github: https://github.com/rubyforgood/babywearing
* Slack channel: #babywearing
Midatlantic Babywearing (MAB) supports the wearing of babies and toddlers for all caregivers.  Babywearing has been shown to improve the bond between child and caregiver, lower stress levels in both the child and caregiver due to the oxytocin released from touch, allows caregivers to be more responsive to the child's cues, and it has been shown to have developmental and physical benefits for the child.

MAB has a lending library, so that their members can try different types of cariers, and find what works best for their family.  They currently have software that works pretty well, but is a strain on their budget. The software will keep track of members & dues as well as the lending library items and their due dates.  We would like to use Twillo and send text reminders when items are due/overdue.
