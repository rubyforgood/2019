# 2019 Ruby for Good Projects

### Diaperbase

Each month over 350,000 children are helped by diaper banks, forgoing their parents having to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding their children and putting diapers on them. There are diaper banks in 44 states and they provide about 4 million diapers a month to needy families. We're going to be using the SaaS that we built last year, making it more robust, and polishing it off to be demoed at the National Diaperbank Network conference later this year. Our goal is for this one to be the best Inventory management product available at the lowest (or "no") cost to diaperbanks. We will be working in tandem with PartnerBase, which is a CRM for Community Partners that will work with the Diaperbanks to handle distribution / order fulfillment /family interaction.

### Diaper Partner

Diaper Partner is a CRM tool designed to help diaper bank partners get diapers to those in need efficiently. Diaper partners are the public facing side of the diaper bank pipeline. As such, diaper partners need an effective way to track diapers from diaper bank all the way through to child recipient and be able to report back to diaper banks.

We’ll be building a multi-tenant system to allow approved diaper bank partners to track their clients (children), fill diaper orders, distribute diaper donations, and report on crucial data points. Diaper Partner will work in tandem with DiaperBase to complement its diaper bank inventory tracking and order fullfillment system via APIs.

### Voices of Consent

Voices of Consent is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide healing to victims, bring awareness to sexual assault, transform society’s response to victims, define what consent is. Based in Washington, DC, this nonprofit operates in 48 states to help survivors in the aftermath of a traumatic event by sending survivor boxes to anyone who requests one free of charge. Boxes are personalized and put together to let survivors know they are not alone after an event and can help provide support as they begin the recovery process including information about laws in their state, free health and counseling services in their area, and other tools and resources needed to start the healing journey. Voices of Consent gets the word out to survivors by talking at schools and churches. The boxes are sent to survivors who request them directly or can be picked up at hospitals or police stations.
